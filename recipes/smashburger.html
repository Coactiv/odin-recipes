                <ol class="recipes">
                    <li>Preheat your lightly oiled grill/cast iron skillet until smoking.</li>
                    <li>Spread butter on buns and toast. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Form meat into 2oz, loosely packed, balls. Place a ball on the grill/skillet, along with a piece of parchment paper to prevent the spatula from sticking. Immediately smash it into a thin round patty. Salt your meat at this stage. </li>
                    <li>Grill until the edges are dark brown and the center is a light pink color. Then flip the burger and put a slice of cheese on top. Grill unil cheese is melted, then you can assemble your burger.</li>
